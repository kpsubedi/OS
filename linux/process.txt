Process Management
------------------
- most fundamental abstraction in a Unix/Linux system.
- An object code in execution - active, alive, running programs- Processes are more than just assembly language; they consist
  data, resoruces, state, and a virtualized computer.

  we will discuss the fundamentals of the process, from creation to termination.

- Unix took an interesting path, one seldom traveled, separating the creation of a new process from the act of loading
  a new binary image.Although the two tasks are performed in tandem much of the time, the division has allowed a great 
  deal of freedom for experimentation and evolution for each of the tasks. 
- While most operating systems offer a single system call to start up a new program, Unix requires two: a fork and an exec. 


Programs, processes, and Threads
--------------------------------
A binary is compiled, executable code lying dormant on a storage medium such as a disk. Colloquially, we may also use the 
term program; large and significant binaries we might call applications. /bin/pwd and /usr/bin/X11 are both binaries. 

A process is a running program. A process includes the binary image, loaded into memory, but also much more: an instance of 
virtualized memory, kernel resoruces such as open files, a security context such as an associated user, and one or more
threads. 
A thread is the unit of activity inside of a process. Each thread has its own virtualized processor, which includes a stack, 
processor state as resgisters, and an instruction pointer. 

In a single threaded process, the process is the thread. There is one instance of virtualized memory and one virtualized 
processor. 

In a multithreaded process, there are multiple threads. As the virtualization of memory is associated with the process, 
the threads all share the same memory address space.
