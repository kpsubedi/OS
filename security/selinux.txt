[Chapter 1. Background]

Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an exciting new technology for securing our computer networks and systems. In a real sense, it represents the culmination of nearly 40 years of operating system security research. For the first time, we have a powerful, flexible, mandatory access control mechanism incorporated into a mainstream, widely distributed in operating system. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of the history of secure operating system research as a means to motivate and set into perspective the value that SELinux brings to today's computer security challenges.
