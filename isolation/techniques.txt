- Privilege Separation Concepts
- Implementation: Technical Controls
  - DAC: *NIX permissions and facl
  - LP: seccomp, capabilities
  - isolation: hardware assisted virtualization, chroot, namespaces, lxc

How do linux containers come about and how we can use them in different scenarioes?

Privilege Separation
--------------------
What are the two key concepts to privilege separation?

- Least Privilege (LP) : Which basically means that you only assign the minimal set of privileges that a particular process of a particular user it requires to execute or carry out its function.
- Segregation of Duties (SoD) : 

What are the technical controls we have to achieve the privilege separation?

- Discretionary Access Control (DAC): implemented in UNIX as file permission
