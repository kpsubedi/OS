- Privilege Separation Concepts
- Implementation: Technical Controls
  - DAC: *NIX permissions and facl
  - LP: seccomp, capabilities
  - isolation: hardware assisted virtualization, chroot, namespaces, lxc

How do linux containers come about and how we can use them in different scenarioes?

Privilege Separation
--------------------
What are the two key concepts to privilege separation?

- Least Privilege (LP) : Which basically means that you only assign the minimal set of privileges that a particular process of a particular user it requires to execute or carry out its function.
- Segregation of Duties (SoD) : This means that for example if you are a financial controller and you approve financial transcations within a company you shouldn't be the same person making a purchase and then you approve it yourself there should be some segregation of duties so that you're being checked by something. 

* No single principle should have too MANY PRIVILEGES.



How do we implement privilege separation in practice? What are the technical controls we have to achieve the privilege separation?

So you might be familiar with discretionary access control (DAC).
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC): implemented in UNIX as file permission for example if
